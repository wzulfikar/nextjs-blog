This is a list of issues that I've dealt with at least once. The list would serve as a shortcut to save me time from trying to google the solution again and again. It's like index of things that had bitten me in the past.

The list will be updated from time to time as new issue occurs.

1. Debug GraphQL requests in browser
	- Use [GraphQL Network](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/graphql-network/igbmhmnkobkjalekgiehijefpkdemocm?hl=en-GB) extension
- GraphQL error "GROUP BY clause is incompatible with sql_mode=only_full_group_by"
	- Remove 'ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY' from mysql's `sql_mode`. Example:
	
		```
		SET GLOBAL sql_mode=(SELECT REPLACE(@@sql_mode,'ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY,',''));
		```

	- See: [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23921117/disable-only-full-group-by)
- Setting git commit author per repo basis
	- run this command in root directory of git repo (based on [dereenigne.org](https://dereenigne.org/git/set-git-email-address-on-a-per-repository-basis/)):
	
	```
	echo "[user]
        name = <author name>
        email = <author oemail>" >> .git/config
	```
- Need to quickly switch proxy server for command line environment
	- use [`proxify.sh`](https://github.com/wzulfikar/lab/blob/master/bash/proxify.sh)
- Preview JSON response in Opera:
	- Install [json-lite](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/json-lite/) extension
- Save time typing `localhost` by aliasing `l` to `localhost`
  - `echo '127.0.0.1 l' >> /etc/hosts`. `curl l:3000` is now equivalent to `curl localhost:3000`
- Create alias for IP address of hostpot-providing device (Android)
  - `echo '192.168.43.1 android.local' >> /etc/hosts`. See: [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17302220/android-get-ip-address-of-a-hotspot-providing-device)
